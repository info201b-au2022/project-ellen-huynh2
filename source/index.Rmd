# Dynamic Summary Paragraph

Our data set provides information regarding crime occurring in the City of Seattle from 2008 to present. Within our data set, there are `r summary_info$num_observations` observations, each with `r summary_info$num_variables` variables. Variables include details about the location, time, and nature of the crime. For example, we found that on average, crimes occurred at `r summary_info$mean_dates` in terms of the date and time. Moreover, there are `r summary_info$num_offenses` different kinds of offenses committed, `r num_against_a_person` of which were committed against a person.
